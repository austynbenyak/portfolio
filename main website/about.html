      Austyn Benyak is a creative interested in type, rock and roll and Levi's jeans.
<br>
<br>
Playfulness and formality play the biggest roles in his work. He creates with the information of form and necessity. But he can't take that too seriously. He's loose and direct.
<br>
<br>
Type is his main interest. He compares it to a pair of Levi's: formed for functionality and played with by the user. He likes that people can make up their own characteristic of the form.
<br>
<br>
At the end of it all he wants to be a rockstar/cowboy.
